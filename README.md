# GoogleMapClustering
The standard features provided by Google maps are indeed useful. And everybody knows that location data plays a huge role in making mobile app more smart and user experience more significant. But there is a way we, the developers, can offer much more than these standard features. 
Thus, I have decided to write a tutorial to demonstrate [how to integrate Google map marker to display lots of location data easily with Android view](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/integrate-google-map-marker-android-view/).

If you face any issue implementing it, you can contact me for help. Also, if you want to implement this feature in your Android app and looking to [hire Android app developer](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/hire-android-developer/Â ) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
